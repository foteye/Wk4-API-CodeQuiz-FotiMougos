### Brief:
This is a time limited quiz that will ask a series of multiple-choice questions via the DOM. A start button is pressed and the quiz begins. Incorrect answers subtract time. Once the time runs out or the quiz is finished, scores are tallied up and a review screen will show score and have an option to try again. High scores persist "IN A SOMEWHERE?" so that we can keep track of who has played and gotten the best scores.

### Lessons Learned:

  * Persistance is irrelevent until this is launched, this will be the last task I complete.
  * Intellisense extensions (i.e. jquery and bootstrap) can save you alot of time flipping back and forth between IDE and documentation in the browser
    * Update: I'm still flipping to browser documentation. sigh.
  * Panels have been deprecated in Bootstrap 4, replaced with Cards. Important to review changelogs, especially in major versions. Take nothing for granted!
  * You don't have to have Javascript interact with local files. You can use the browser cache to store data.
  * Event handlers should have as little code as possible in them. The only operation they are there to do is to HANDLE AN EVENT.
  * jQuery makes things REALLY easy to manipulate, adding classes, finding children, and handling events.
  * Classes don't really exist pre-ES6, but they are a really neat way of structuring your program.
