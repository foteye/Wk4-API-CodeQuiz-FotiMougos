### Brief:
This is a time limited quiz that will ask a series of multiple-choice questions via the DOM. A start button is pressed and the quiz begins. Incorrect answers subtract time. Once the time runs out or the quiz is finished, scores are tallied up and a review screen will show score and have an option to try again. High scores persist "IN A SOMEWHERE?" so that we can keep track of who has played and gotten the best scores.
